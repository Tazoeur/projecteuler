#Project Euler

I like the [project euler](https://projecteuler.net) and the [Rust]() language so I created this repo to keep track of my progress.

I have absolutely no pretention about the effectiveness of the functions I've coded.

If you are interested in the project euler, refrain yourself from peeking into the files, you will be self-rewarded at the end of a problem that you are able to solve alone.
